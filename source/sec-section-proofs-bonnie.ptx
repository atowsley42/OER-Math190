                <title>The square root of 2 is irrational!</title>
                <p>
                    Let's prove that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational. We will use contradiction.  Before reading the proof, think about how this may look.  What's the opposite of irrational? What does it mean?

            <theorem xml:id="thm-sqrt2irrational">
                <statement>
                    <p>
                       The number <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational. 
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </theorem>
            
            <proof>
                <p>
                Suppose that the theorem statement is wrong.  So, assume that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}</m> for some integers <m>a, b</m> with <m>b \neq 0</m> where <m>a, b</m> have no common divisors.
                </p>
                <p>
                Then <m>2=\frac{a^2}{b^2}</m> and equivalently <m>2b^2=a^2</m>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since <m>a^2=2b^2</m>, that means that <m>a^2</m> is divisible by 2.
                     Since <m>a</m> is an integer, <m>a</m> is divisble by 2.  But then <m>a^2</m> is divisble by 4.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    But then we must have that <m>b^2</m> is divisble by 2, which means that <m>b</m> is divisble by 2, a contradiction of the assumption that <m>a,b</m> have no common divisors.
                </p>


            </proof>
        <p>This isn't magical for 2.  We can use the same idea for <m>\sqrt{3}</m> for example.</p>
